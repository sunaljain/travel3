        <h3>Who are Explorers?</h3>
        <p>Explorers are the elite members of Campture community. Some are professionals, but most are regular folks: engineers, doctors, students, moms, fathers etc. They’re good people and they inspire us to get outside. More often, they’re also incredible photographers and writers, sharing their experiences on Instagram, blogs or helping out in forums.</p>

        <h3>What does it mean to be a Campture Explorer?</h3>
        <p>Our Explorers are the most active and dedicated members of our community - they add their favourite adventures, leave detailed reviews, share updated trail reports, and include great photography. We’re partnering with the industry’s top brands to provide exclusive discounts to our team of Explorers.</p>
        <p>The Explorer Program is NOT the same as writing for the Campture blog. If you're interested in writing articles (Tips For Your First Solo Backpacking Trip, 5 places to go trekking in April, How To Build stamina for adventure trips etc) You can reach out to us on info@campture.com and we can provide you an author access for your contribution.</p>
        <p>Being an Explorer is NOT about getting featured on Instagram. We're looking for amazing people who want to help shape this community, not get more followers.</p>
        <h3>How do I become a Campture Explorer?</h3>
        <p>Before you can be considered for our Explorer Program, you’ll need to have had at least 6 adventures featured by our editors.</p>
        <p>Here's a quick breakdown:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>You need to have added new, unique, adventures to the site.</li>
            <li>At least 6 of those adventures need to have been featured.</li>
            <li>You need to be an active member on the site, which means bookmarking adventures, creating lists, rating and reviewing adventures, and inviting your friends to join this growing community.</li>
            <li>Quality photography and detailed writing are important to us as we know they are to you, so show us your best.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>What are the Perks?</h3>
        <p>As an Explorer, you’ll receive team swag, VIP access to local events, and exclusive deals with brands large and small. Depending on the brands, our team has access to new gear and other rad opportunities. We can’t always get gear to everyone, but if you make yourself a stand-out member of the community, we’ll do everything we can to reward you in any way we can!
        </p>
        <p>Incredible adventures created by people like you, from across the globe.</p>
        <p>Our mission is to discover adventures, whether just down the street or across the globe, by inspiring people to explore and share their experiences.</p>
